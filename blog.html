          <p>The Marangu route, also known as the “Coca-Cola” route, is the oldest, most well established route on Kilimanjaro. This is the only route which offers sleeping huts in dormitory style accommodations in lieu of camping. There are 60 bunk beds each at Mandara and Kibo Huts, and 120 bunk beds at Horombo Hut. Guests are supplied with mattresses and pillows, but sleeping bags are still required. The huts have communal dining halls and basic washrooms, ranging from flushing toilets and running water at the lower huts to long drop toilets and buckets of water at Kibo Hut.</p>
        <p>The five day variation does not have an acclimatization day on day three at Horombo Hut.</p>

          <p class="subheading"><span><font color="blue"><b>Duration:</b></font></span> <b>6 Days</b>  </p>
          <p>Does Kilimanjaro hold a special fascination for you? Are you planning to realise your dream through the Shira Route? Take a deep breath and read through! We say a deep breath because the Shira route catapults you to an altitude of 3600 meters on the very first day and leaves you gasping for air. That’s your first clue. If you are an amateur or someone not at the peak of your physical prowess- Stay away! Altitude sickness can claim you even before you begin your trek. The route has been a favourite of intrepid trekkers who believes in going off the beaten path. Shira takes a western approach to the Kilimanjaro. Scenic and encrusted with beautiful vistas the route will take you through luscious forests, open grassy moorlands, the Shira caldera, the stupendous rock formations of the Shira plateau, lava towers, Senecio forests towards the steep ridges awaiting to lead you to the daunting Barranco Wall. A steep climb up the wall will lead you to the on the south-eastern flank of Kibo, with superb vistas of the Southern Icefields only to descend into the Karanga valley and then a hike to Barafu camp-
            The final assault to the top begins here, at midnight! It will be extreme and grueling and will put to test all your physical and mental sinews. But at stake is the Stella Point (5,735m) and the magnificent sunrise over Mawenzi. If you have any gas left in your tank then challenge yourself to a two hour round trip from Stella Point along the crater rim to Uhuru Peak (5,896m) to bask in the elevating feeling of achievement atop Africa's highest point. The descent will be through the Mweka route traversing the tropical rainforests. Make sure to use your trekking poles for rocky scree slide descent. In recent years Shira route has been upstaged by the Lemosho route but it nevertheless continues to attract the adventure seeker who seeks bonhomie with Africa’s tallest in solitude.

          <p class="subheading"><span><font color="blue"><b>Duration:</b></font></span> <b>7 Days</b></p>
          <p>The Rongai route is the only route that approaches Kilimanjaro from the north, close to the Kenyan border. Though gaining popularity amongst climbers, this route still experiences low crowds. Rongai has a more gradual slope than the mountain’s other routes. It is the preferred route for those looking for an alternative to the popular Marangu route, for those who would like a more remote hike, and for those who are climbing during the rainy season (the north side receives less precipitation). Rongai is a moderately difficult route, and is highly recommended, especially for those with less backpacking experience.

            Although the scenery is not as varied as the western routes, Rongai makes up for this by passing through true wilderness areas for nearly the entire way. Descent is made via the Marangu route.
            </p>
            <p>The six day variation does not have an acclimatization day on day four at Mawenzi Tarn.</p>

          <p class="subheading"><span><font color="blue"><b>Duration:</b></font></span> <b>7 Days</b></p>
          <p>The Umbwe route has a well-deserved reputation of being the most challenging route on Mount Kilimanjaro. Due to the fast ascent to high altitude, this route does not provide the necessary stages for acclimatization. Although the number of people on this trail is very low, the chances of success are also low. Umbwe is considered to be very difficult, taxing route – one that should only be attempted by strong hikers who are confident in their ability to acclimatize quickly to altitude.

            Approaching from the south, the Umbwe route is a short, steep and direct climb. After reaching Barranco Camp, the trail turns east and traverses underneath Kilimanjaro’s Southern Ice Field on a path known as the Southern Circuit before summiting from Barafu. Descent is made via the Mweka route.
            </p>
            <p>The seven day variation adds an acclimatization day on day three at Barranco Camp.</p>

          <p class="subheading"><span><font color="blue"><b>Duration:</b></font></span> <b>2 Days & 3 Days</b></p>
          <p>The Serengeti National Park is famous for good reason. It is the scene of the incredible annual migration of 1.5 million wildebeest, somehow sensing how to follow the greenest plains for survival. The Maasai, who have grazed their cattle here for millennia, call it 'the place where the land moves on forever'. Of course, the wildebeest share this astounding home with many other fascinating animals, including top predators and even a few rare black rhino.</p>
          <p><b>Ngorongoro</b></p>
          <p>Ngorongoro National Park Entirely deserving of its UNESCO world heritage site status, this mid-size park contains three volcanic craters, forests, gorges, bush land & savannah. The famous Ngorongoro crater, 300 million years old, 20km in diameter and 600m deep, is the world's largest caldera. The area boasts the oldest known hominid footprints from 3.6 million years ago, and now sets a precedent for how humans and wildlife can coexist harmoniously. The wildlife in this area is stunning, diverse and abundant, giving a great chance of spotting "the big 5".</p>

          <p class="subheading"><span><font color="blue"><b>Duration:</b></font></span> <b>7 Days</b></p>
          <p>The Machame route, also known as the “Whiskey” route, is the most popular route on Kilimanjaro. Machame’s draw is in its scenic beauty. However, the trail is considered difficult, steep and challenging, particularly due to its shorter itinerary. Therefore this route is better suited for more adventurous folks or those with some high altitude, hiking or backpacking experience.

            The route approaches Mount Kilimanjaro from the south, beginning with a short drive from Moshi to Machame Gate. The path leads hikers through the rain forest to Shira Plateau. Here, many of Kilimanjaro’s routes converge. Then the route turns east and traverses underneath Kilimanjaro’s Southern Ice Field on a path known as the Southern Circuit before summiting from Barafu. Descent is made via the Mweka route.
            </p>
            <p>The six day variation combines days four and five, going from Barranco Camp to Barafu Camp without staying at Karanga.</p>

          <p>The Lemosho route is one of the newer routes on Mount Kilimanjaro. The route begins in the west and rather than simply intersecting Shira Plateau (like Machame), Lemosho crosses it from Shira Ridge to Shira Camp. Climbers encounter low traffic until the route joins the Machame route. Afterwards, Lemosho follows the same route through Lava Tower, Barranco and Barafu, known as the southern circuit.

            The minimum number of days required for this route is six days, although eight days is ideal.
            
            Lemosho is considered the most beautiful route on Kilimanjaro and grants panoramic vistas on various sides of the mountain. It is our favorite route because it offers a great balance of low traffic, scenic views and a high summit success rate. Thus, Lemosho comes highly recommended. Most of our clients use Lemosho.

          <h3><a href="#"><font color="green"><b>Serengeti Wildebeest Migration Safari Route</b></font></a></h3>
          <p class="subheading"><span><font color="blue"><b>Duration:</b></font></span> <b>9 Days</b></p>
          <p>Each year, almost two million wildebeest and 20 000 plains game migrate from Tanzania's Serengeti to the south of Kenya's Masai Mara in search of lush grazing grounds and life-giving water. This treacherous odessey is dictated by the seasons and where the rains are, the wildebeest are not far behind. This epic journey from north to south spans almost 3000 kilometres and is virtually endless.

            In the plains of the Serengeti in the Orriental Africa, 1,300,000 animals embark each year on the most epic migration of the earth. The largest mass movement of terrestrial mammals on the planet is chasing African storms in search of new pastures, starting a journey full of dangers. And there are more carnivorous animals hunting through these savannahs than anywhere else in the world. The arrival of the herds heralds an unparalleled food frenzy in the natural world. The migration of the wildebeest is without a doubt the greatest journey of nature.
            
            As seasonal storms water the vast plains of the southern Serengeti, they bring to life the lush meadows that attract the largest concentration of herbivorous animals on the planet. Here the volcanic lands give rise to pastures rich in minerals and nutrients, necessary to feed the large herds that gather in gigantic groups of tens of thousands of individuals, seeking refuge for the group to face this great annual journey. The start of the great migration depends entirely on the rain seasons each year, so, although not exactly, they repeat a fairly predictable pattern annually. The map shows the migration movement month by month. The arrows represent the movement of the main herds.

          <p class="subheading"><span><font color="blue"><b>Duration:</b></font></span> <b>8 Days</b></p>
          <p>Known as the Spice Island, the beautiful island of Zanzibar on Africa’s east coast is bursting with culture and history, seemingly at odds with its idyllic geography of white-sand beaches with palms swaying lazily in the sea breeze. Together this makes Zanzibar a fabulous place to explore as well as a dream to relax and unwind.
            Zanzibar is a small misunderstood island, the island where reality is not the one we expected. It has built its reputation on tourist beaches, but it is for its history it deserves your visit. We have already forgotten that this island has seen bloodshed, sweat and tears of those who had been uprooted from their land and forced to embark in Bagamoyo (nearest mainland port of the island) to work on plantations . Who knows that the spice trade was flourishing in the seventeenth century and spices were as coveted as oil today!
            
            Wars, invasions, intrigues of the clans and slavery have created a unique and rich history on such a small territory.
            Today, it is regrettable that there are only some near-abandoned ruins, beautiful doors poorly preserved and the tourist pressure suppresses its past every day a little more.
            Zanzibar is an independent island (in theory, because the big sister Tanzania is pulling almost all the strings), we do not provide tourism service in the island apart from hotels. Local agencies are numerous, making the right choice…
            
            This 8 days Tanzania safari and Zanzibar tour gives you the ultimate opportunity to soak in the sun while you relax on the sandy beaches of Zanzibar island after an adventurous safari in the Northern Circuit of Tanzania. Tour Duration: 6 Days / 5 Nights:
            Parks to Visit: Arusha / Manyara/Serengeti / Ngorongoro / Zanzibar..
            Departure Days: Daily Departures with Exclusive use of Vehicle and Driver Guide.

It has built its reputation on tourist beaches, but it is for its history it deserves your visit. We have already forgotten that this island has seen bloodshed, sweat and tears of those who had been uprooted from their land and forced to embark in Bagamoyo (nearest mainland port of the island) to work on plantations . Who knows that the spice trade was flourishing in the seventeenth century and spices were as coveted as oil today!
            
            Wars, invasions, intrigues of the clans and slavery have created a unique and rich history on such a small territory.
            Today, it is regrettable that there are only some near-abandoned ruins, beautiful doors poorly preserved and the tourist pressure suppresses its past every day a little more.
            Zanzibar is an independent island (in theory, because the big sister Tanzania is pulling almost all the strings), we do not provide tourism service in the island apart from hotels. Local agencies are numerous, making the right choice…

          <p>The Northern Circuit route is one of the best routes on Kilimanjaro, offering nearly 360 degrees of beautiful scenery including the quiet, rarely visited northern slopes. As the longest route on Kilimanjaro, the Northern Circuit also has the most acclimatization time and the highest summit success rate. Thus, the Northern Circuit route is highly recommended.

            The route approaches Mount Kilimanjaro from the west, beginning with a long drive from Moshi to Londorossi Gate. From there, the first two days are spent trekking through the rainforest to Shira Ridge, before crossing the Shira Plateau. The route then heads north and circles clockwise from Moir Hut to Buffalo Camp to School Hut, before summiting from the east. Descend is made via the Mweka route.
            
            A 10 day variation that includes an overnight at Crater Camp is available as a private climb by special request.
